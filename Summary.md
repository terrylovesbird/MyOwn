Survey of Three Open Source Network Monitoring Projects

The projects surveyed in this paper are Nagios, OpenNMS and Zenoss.

Developer interest
	1. Nagios
　　　　	The interest of the developer is to build a software project which could provide network services to small businesses and he also wants it cheap to work and flexible.
	2. OpenNMS
		OpenNMS is now being developed by a large team. Their interest is to make OpenNMS the best network management application platform providing solutions for enterprises and carries.
	3. Zenoss
　　　　	The key principles that drove their initial offerings are even more relevant today as organizations drive towards the vision of automated operations and hybrid cloud infrastructure.

User interest
	An internet poll results of network monitoring application of 2010 year, shows the top three popular softwares voted by people are Nagios(61.76%), OpenNMS(11.89%) and Zenoss(6.46%).
	Since the main users of Nagios are individual and small businesses, it takes most votes. The customers of OpenNMS are mainly enterprises and carries, so it has less votes than Nagios. As Zenoss drives its initial offerings to big organizations, so it gets the least votes of the three. And for others network monitoring projects, the total percent of votes is only 19.89%.

Appropriateness of documentation
	For all of three projects, they have very entire and complete documentation, from almost every aspects to let readers know about them. Most of their documentation are of online form, some of them have real books. So if I need to give points to the appropriateness of their documentation, I think they all deserve full points.

Readability and maintainability of the code
	First of all, we should know the languages they use to develop:
　　　　	Nagios: C
　　　　	OpenNMS: Java, Jsp/Servlet, Spring MVC
　　　　	Zenoss: Python
	So if I need to rank them from two aspects, readability and maintainability, I will give the result below. (Order from high to low)
　　		Readability: Zenoss, Nagios, OpenNMS
　　		Maintainability: OpenNMS, Zenoss, Nagios


Evidence of other appropriate software engineering practices
　　License
　　　　Nagios: GPL
　　　　OpenNMS: Free
　　　　Zenoss: GPL2

Opportunities to contribute to the project
	All of them are openly welcome and recruiting people to contribute to their projects, and they have mature guide book and platform for people even newbies to join in and work with everyone. Some of them offer paid job positions.
