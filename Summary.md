###Nagios
<p>
Through searching “network monitoring projects” on google and looking at the results it fed back, I found that [*Nagios*] is the most popular among them. So I took a deeper look at, I found "Nagios is a powerful monitoring system that enables organizations to identify and resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect critical business processes." The main users of Nagios are individual and small businesses.  
</p>

<p>
Taking a look at the website (http://www.nagios.org/about/overview/), I find the functions of Nagios can be breifly concluded as [Monitoring] IT staff configure Nagios to monitor critical IT infrastructure components, including system metrics, network protocols, applications, services, servers, and network infrastructure. [Alerting] Nagios sends alerts when critical infrastructure components fail and recover, providing administrators with notice of important events. Alerts can be delivered via email, SMS, or custom script. [Response] IT staff can acknowledge alerts and begin resolving outages and investigating security alerts immediately. Alerts can be escalated to different groups if alerts are not acknowledged in a timely manner. [Reporting] Reports provide a historical record of outages, events, notifications, and alert response for later review. Availability reports help ensure your SLAs are being met. [Maintenance] Scheduled downtime prevents alerts during scheduled maintenance and upgrade windows. [Planning] Trending and capacity planning graphs and reports allow you to identify necessary infrastructure upgrades before failures occur.

<p>
The newest version is Nagios XI, which is not free and can be bought online. I didnt find certain entire FOSS version on the website directly, but one of Nagios (5.3.4) on Github (https://github.com/tas50/nagios#time-periods).
</p>

<p>
The language of this version on Github is Ruby, while that of the official version is C. In analyzing the files, the code of Nagios (5.3.4) has excellent readability and maintainability. It has very entire and complete documentation, from almost every aspects to let readers know about them. Most of their documentation are of online form. (http://www.nagios.org/documentation)
</p>

<p>
There are many links on the website to tell people they are welcome to join in this project. Like "Forum", "Get involved" and "Projects". The entire project is separated to several parts and I think it is easier for people to find their target.
